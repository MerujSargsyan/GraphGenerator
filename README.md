A simple program where the user can create vertecies which are automatically connected to the previously added vertecie.

The purpose of this project is to study graph theory in my MATH 154 class during my studies at UCSD.

Here are the purposes of each class explained breiefly:

- Main.java simply executes the program with a base size of 750 by 500 pixels. Also adding required functionality to begin the program.
- Grid.java creates a grid system so that the user cannot place points too close to eachother, it is also used to gather
  the position of verticies and lines.
- Line.java is simply used to draw lines from a starting point to an ending point.
- Vertex.java is simply used to draw vertecies and keep track of their positions.
- Shape.java is a superclass to Line and Vertex, simply keeping track of their positon.

Instructions:
Press backspace to delete the most recently added line and point
Press space to switch between dark mode and light mode
